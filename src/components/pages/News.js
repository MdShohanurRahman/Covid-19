        On Monday, March 30, the Embassy helped many Americans and their family
        members depart Dhaka for the United States on a chartered flight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The U.S. Department of State and U.S. Embassy Bangladesh have arranged
        another special chartered flight for U.S. citizens and their families
        departing Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on Sunday,
        April 5, 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        This flight will include a Dhaka to Doha, Qatar leg and an onward
        connecting flight to Dulles International Airport, Washington, D.C.
        &nbsp; Passengers will remain on the airplane in Doha.
      </p>
      <p>
        This flight is not free. All passengers will need to reimburse the U.S.
        Government for the cost of the flight. A legal document, called a
        promissory note, for the full cost of the flight must be signed by each
        adult passenger before boarding. Currently, we do not know the cost of
        each ticket. No cash or credit card payments will be accepted at the
        airport. Please review payment information on promissory notes
        (DS-5528)&nbsp;

        additional flights in the upcoming days.

        <strong>
          Unless you receive an email from the U.S Embassy in Bangladesh
          confirming your flight, please do not come to the airport in Dhaka.
